My name is Simon Chalifoux. I have been in the IT space since 2010, but my passion for computers goes back much further.
I worked my way from first level helpdesk-like jobs up to a respectable DevOps lead position in a fast-growing software company.
From 10,000 feet, I am probably an "okay" sysadmin and though I know how to read and write code, I am no developer. That being said, 
I think I still end up to be a fierce DevOps evangelist and I am committed to tearing down the wall between operations and development.

### What makes you click?
Working with public cloud providers and cloud-native technology, automating stuff, writing (often bad) code, learning stuff.
I like to say that I don't care about technology flame wars.
In my honest opinion, Powershell, Python, Windows, Linux, AWS, Azure, Ansible, Terraform are all such incredible tools/platforms to work with.

On a less technical level, I do love reading and learning about the challenges and patterns of enterprise digital transformation and how DevOps
can help achieve said transformation.


### Why a blog?

The main objective was to keep notes of my learnings and track my own progression. 
Secondly, it is said that one of the best ways to fully integrate a notion is to teach it to someone else.
Having often taught lunch & learns or internal training sessions, I strongly agree with that statement and I was looking
for a way to do just that outside of my regular job context.

I have to admit that I also hope this will allow me to better engage with the community of IT folks.
