With more and more of our workloads getting deployed into Kubernetes,
I felt it was the right time to measure my experience and skills against the CNCF certifications.
So there it is, I am now a **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)**. For those who plan on going down the
same road, let me share with you a few tips and some info about the CKA.

### Preparation

Well, apart from almost two years of using Kubernetes in production,
I chose a Udemy course (Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests from Mumshad Mannambeth) to prepare for this exam.
I can say it was indeed enough. The lab platform based on Katacoda is pretty dope and the exercises were well designed. 
That being said, my job has me spend a lot of time reading blog posts and documentation from the official Kubernetes website,
so it was most definitely an advantage.

### The Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam

So this exam is task based. This means there are no multiple choices or true/false questions.
You get an environment with multiple clusters you can connect to and a list of tasks to complete.
With the newest version of the exam that came out in September, you have 2 hours to complete 15 to 25 tasks.
The passing score is 66%, which makes the certification pretty accessible to anybody, in my opinion.

This certification aims to validate if you can deploy and operate the Kubernetes control plane and will
also measure if you can deploy the usual Kubernetes objects such as deployments, pods and services.
Since that certification targets mostly the control plane, I think that if you plan on using a
managed version of Kubernetes such as AKS/EKS or GKE, this will probably not bring you as much value as CKA's sibling, the CKAD.

It will definitely help you understand how the components work together, but if you don't plan on deploying your own cluster,
you should probably go for the CKAD first.
The Linux Foundation will release later this fall the CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security specialist) certification and
the CKA will be a prerequisite to obtain that certification, so it might be an additional incentive to target it even if you don't plan to manage the Kubernetes control plane yourself. 

During the exam, you are allowed to access the official Kubernetes documentation site, the Kubernetes blog and the Kubernetes
GitHub repository.

### On exam day

The exam is scheduled through an online proctoring service called PSI. As with all of those online proctored exams, 
you WILL need to clean up your desk (no nothing, rien... nada) except a single monitor or your laptop. You will be allowed only two tabs
in your Google Chrome browser (the only one supported for the exam). 

The experience was pretty good and the exam platform was flawless, in my opinion. 

### Tips for the exam

Here are my tips for all the fellow exam takers:

1. **Manage your time:** The major challenge of this certification is the time (or the lack of time).
Allow yourself a maximum number of minutes for each question. If you reach that maximum skip that question. A lot of the questions are
actually pretty simple and can be completed with a few simple commands. You need to make sure to have the time to hit those low-hanging fruits.
2. **Know your ETCD:** Make sure to know how to backup and restore ETCD. FYI, the ETCD restore command is not available in the official K8s
documentation, it one of the rare things you will need to memorize.
3. **Vim:** Get acquainted to Vim. There is probably alternative like nano or emacs on the exams nodes too, but I can confirm Vim was available. 
4. **Be imperative:** Know your imperative command to either directly deploy resources or generate base yaml configurations that you can then edit
to fit the question. 
5. **YAML sucks:** Yep, I said it. Good chance you will hit an indentation error at some point or you will declare a map instead of a list at another. Know you YAML guys... That's another good incentive for using imperative commands. 
6. **Make a curated list of favourites:** Get a folder of preselected favourites in your browser. I bookmarked all the resources example 
that I could not generate using imperative commands and I used this list during the exam. It will be much faster than using the search feature during your exam. 
7. **Practice... practice, practice, practice.** It is a hands-on exam, you need to know your sh** and you know how to type fast. You can enable an alias and autocompletion for kubectl at the beginning of the exam if it helps you.


### Conclusion

To sum up, I'd say it was a nice experience overall. The exam is priced at 300$USD, but you can find discount coupons everywhere to drop almost 40$USD to 50$USD from the original price. You also get a free retake if you fail (which is pretty cool in my opinion). I will definitely take the CKAD before the end of 2020. The hands-on experience makes the exam almost fun and definitely challenging. 

As the lead of a Cloud Ops team, I would value this certification on an applicant's resume probably more than any MCQ based cert. Kudos Linux Foundation/CNCF
