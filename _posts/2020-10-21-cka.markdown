With more and more of our workloads getting deployed into Kubernetes,
I felt it was the right time to measure my experience and skills against the CNCF certifications.
So there it is, I am now a **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)**. For those who plan on going down the
same road, let me share with you a few tips and some information about the CKA.

### Preparation

Well appart from a year of using Kubernetes in production,
I chose a Udemy course (Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests from Mumshad Mannambeth) to prepare to this exam.
I can say it was indeed enough. The lab platform based on Katacoda is pretty dope and the exercises were well designed. 
That being said, my job make me spend a lot of time reading blog posts and documentation from the official Kubernetes website,
so it was most definitely an advantage.

### The Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam

So this exam is task based. This means there are no multiple-choices or true/false questions.
You get an environment with multiple clusters you can connect to and a list of tasks to complete.
With the newest version of the exam that came out in September, you have 2 hours to complete 15 to 25 tasks.
The passing score is 66%, which makes the certificate pretty accessible to anybody in my opinion.

This certification aims to validate if you can deploy and operate the Kubernetes control-plane and will
also measure if you can deploy the usual Kubernetes objects such as deployments, pods and services.
Since that certification targets mostly the control-plane, it leads me to think that if you plan on using a
managed version of Kubernetes such as AKS/EKS or GKE, this will not bring you as much value as the CKAD.

It willdefinitely help you understand how the components work together, but if you don't plan on deploying your own cluster,
you should probably go for the CKAD first.
The Linux Foundation will release later this fall the CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security sepcialist) certification and
the CKA will be a prerequisite to obtain that certificat, so it might be an additional incentive to target it even if you don't plan on managing 
Kubernetes control-plane yourself. 

During the exam, you are allow to access the official Kubernetes documentation site, the Kubernetes blog and the Kubernetes
GitHub repository

### On exam day

This exam is scheduled through an online proctoring service called Examity. The scheduling process was easy. Connecting with
the proctor was also quite simple. You have an hour to answer about 60 questions (multiple choices, true/false). 
You can skip questions and come back later. You can mark a question for review.

It took me about 20 minutes to make a first quick pass at all the questions. I marked a few ones for review. 
Few seconds after answering the last one, the Zoom meeting (that Examity use to monitor you during the exam)
disconnected. When this happens, the exam is paused, but the timer does not stop.
I started working with Examity support using the chat function. Long story short, it took 45 minutes to get back on the Zoom meeting. 

The moment I got back on track, the exam automatically ended
(timer went all the way down to 0 and my proctor didn't pause it even though the support guy I was in contact with assured me they would).
Fortunately for me, I still passed with flying colors and got my badge. 
In that situation, I decided to not make a fuss about the lost time and went my merry way. 
If someone from HashiCorp ever read this... Examity... not a big fan!!

### Things I learned

Even though a lot of the content of the exam was knowledge I already had, I've learned a few interesting things that I wanted to mention

- You can speed-up significantly a `plan` or `apply` operation by using the `-refresh=false` flag to use the current state as-is. 
*While this could cause you to rely on a state that drifted from the real resources configuration, 
it has the benefit of accelerating the feedback loop a lot when implementing/testing a new part of your configuration.*

- To save the execution plan of a destroy operation, you need to use `terraform plan -destroy -out plan.out` not the `terraform destroy` command

- One should use the provisioner feature as a last resort for a lot of very logical reasons. 
The one I retain was that it makes Terraform a lot less portable as it creates external dependencies 
(like the availability of some local binaries or a requirement for direct connectivity).

- It is recommended to use a minimum version `>=` provider constraint for shared child modules. For root modules, the recommendation is to set both the lower and higher bounds `~>`
).

- You can locally cache provider binaries to speed up the `init` workflow and save on space (versus downloading them each time for each configuration)

- HashiCorp Vault looks like a pretty awesome secret management platform. I will definitely need to set up some lab in the short term to experiment.


### Conclusion

To sum up, I'd say it was a nice experience overall. The exam will most definitely not be a challenge if you have any real Terraform experience under your belt.
The exam cost is only 75$USD so it is an easy target on all fronts. Probably more at the "foundational" level of certification rather than at the "associate" one (in my opinion).
As the head of a Cloud Ops team, I would value this certification on an applicant's resume.
